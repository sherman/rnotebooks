Suppose, a known mean value is 146 and we know, that our experiment should increase mean value.
```{r}
oldMean <- 146
```

Let's do the experiment
```{r}
data <- round(rnorm(100, 150, 10))
```

And let's see the experiment's mean value.
```{r}
mean(data)
```
The old mean is less than the experiment mean value. But does it matter statistically?
For answer to this question we can use [T-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test)
So, our $H_0$ is that mean values are equals. An alternative hypothesis is that the experiment's mean value is greater than the old one.

```{r}
t.test(data, mu = oldMean)
```
P-value is small enough so that we can reject H_0 and accept the alternative hypothesis.
