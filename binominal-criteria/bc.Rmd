A data description.
1 - pass
0 - fail

n - total trials

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# generate data
n <- 16
data <- sample(c(0,1), 16, replace = TRUE)

# get probabilty of passed trials
probabilities <- c()
for (i in 1:n)
  probabilities[i] <- dbinom(i, n, 0.5)


df <- data.frame("n" = c(1:length(probabilities)), "v" = probabilities)
qplot(x = df$n, y = df$v)
```

Find a probability of getting 6 or less passed trial

```{r}
pbinom(6, 12, 0.5)
```
